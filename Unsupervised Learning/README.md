# Domain Adaptation for Brick Kiln Detection

This project investigates **unsupervised domain adaptation** techniques for detecting **brick kilns** in satellite imagery. It utilizes **image-to-image translation**, including **CycleGAN** and **CUT**, along with **object relabeling** and a **YOLO**-based detection pipeline. The primary objective is to improve **cross-region generalization** by enabling detection models to perform effectively in areas lacking **labeled data**.

## Motivation

- India has over **150,000 brick kilns**, contributing significantly to **air pollution** and **topsoil loss**.
- Kilns are often associated with **forced labor** and **unsafe working conditions**.
- Object detectors like **YOLO** perform well within a region but drop **40â€“50% in accuracy** across regions due to **domain shift**.
- This project addresses domain shift using **style transfer** and **label refinement**.

## Approach

1. **Translate source images** (e.g., from Delhi) to mimic the target region's style (e.g., West Bengal) using CycleGAN or CUT.
2. **Transfer brick kiln annotations** from source to translated images using original bounding boxes.
3. **Use a YOLO model trained on source images** to generate refined labels on the synthetic images.
4. **Train a new YOLO model** on these new images and labels **to evaluate on target region images**.
